=========================================
      COMPLEX INTERACTION: GRAVITY RUNNER
=========================================

1. [INITIAL PROMPT - COPY THIS AND PASTE WHEN AGENT STARTS]
------------------------------------------------------------
I want to create a physics-based puzzle platformer called "Gravity Runner".
The player controls a blue square character that can move left/right and jump.
The game should feature:
- Gravity that pulls the player down.
- Platforms to jump on.
- Spikes that kill the player on contact (restart level).
- Coins to collect (score increases by 10).
- A locked door at the end of the level that requires a key to open.
- A "key" item placed somewhere in the level.
- A simple enemy that patrols back and forth on a platform.
- When the player reaches the open door, show a "Level Complete" screen.
- Use simple geometric shapes ensuring a clean, modern aesthetic with a dark background.
------------------------------------------------------------


2. [EXPECTED AGENT FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (EXAMPLE)]
------------------------------------------------------------
AI: Should the player have a double jump ability?
AI: How many lives does the player have, or is it instant death?
AI: Should the level layout be random or predefined?
------------------------------------------------------------


3. [YOUR ANSWERS - COPY THIS IF ASKED]
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Yes, add a double jump mechanic.
2. Instant death on spikes or enemy contact, but infinite retries.
3. Create a single, well-designed predefined level layout that demonstrates all mechanics (platforms, spikes, enemy, key, door).
------------------------------------------------------------


4. [EXPECTED COMPLEX OUTPUT LOGIC]
------------------------------------------------------------
The agent should generate:
- A Game Loop (requestAnimationFrame)
- A Physics Engine (velocity, friction, gravity, collision detection)
- Entity Classes (Player, Platform, Enemy, Collectible)
- State Management (Menu -> Playing -> Game Over / Win)
- A defined Level Map (likely an array of strings or objects)

Files generated:
- index.html (Canvas setup)
- style.css (Modern dark theme, UI styling)
- game.js (Complex logic, classes, event listeners)

Open 'output/index.html' to play.
